Platform game built in Javascript.


<b>Project Goal: </b>A technical example to demonstrate the classic input/calc/render loop.


Why Javascript?
---------------
It would hardly be the best language for a modern game if that was the goal, but it is very easy to get a project up and running quickly. The principle being demonstrated by this project is the input/calc/render loop which could then be used in a more suitable language in the long run.


Can I take your code?
---------------
I'm putting this all under GPL v3, so within the limitations of that, yes.
